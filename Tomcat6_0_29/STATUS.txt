PATCHES PROPOSED TO BACKPORT:
  [ New proposals should be added at the end of the list ]

* Fix the maven stuff for the maven repo.
  Before it does't find tomcat-juli.jar and the remoteRepository seems broken .
  http://people.apache.org/~jfclere/patches/maven.patch.100711
  +1: jfclere
  -1: fhanik - easier to pass in the root path (lib/bin) to the macro instead of hacking around it
               if we remove the SCP auto feature, then there should be something to replace it with
               (http://ant.apache.org/manual/OptionalTasks/scp.html)  
  +1: kkolinko: +1 for the updated patch (maven.patch.100711)
      I still think that it is not so good to remove the old code of <remoteRepository/>,
      because it ignores ${maven.repo.url} parameter provided by deploy-snapshot,
      deploy-staging and deploy-release targets. Maybe leave old code as a comment
      and fix it later if needed? I think that actually nobody besides the release manager
      uses this, so I am letting this pass.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=48545
  Truststores don't have to have passwords
  Based on a patch by 'smmwpf54'
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=910266
  +1: markt
  -1: jfclere: Doc says it should use keystorePass (http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/config/http.html).
               so that would break existing configurations.
      markt: It shouldn't break existing configs. JSSE allows trust stores to be
             read without providing the password
      kkolinko: 1. My understanding of KeyStore.load(stream,pwd) doc is that when the
             password is not needed to open a store, it is used to verify its integrity.
             So, this patch changes behaviour: skips the verification.
             2. Note, that the password might be provided by overriding the
             getKeystorePassword() method. There is no way to provide such password
             for the truststore in the new code.
             3. I would be fine if this new behaviour in TC6 were triggered by some
             system property, but defaults to the old behaviour.

  Failure of one connector should not leave some connectors started and some
  ignored
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2010-06-14-bug49030.patch
  +1: markt
  -1: kkolinko: it breaks the fix for BZ 48625
    https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49030#c4

  Alternative patch:
  https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/attachment.cgi?id=25633
  +1: kkolinko
  -1:

* Configure Tomcat to use HttpOnly for session cookies by default
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2010-04-21_tc6_context_httpOnly.patch
  +1: kkolinko
  -0: markt - There wasn't consensus previously.
            - If you are going to change the default, do it in the code
  -1:

* Expose the new WebappLoader flag in the VirtualWebappLoader,
  but allow alternative name searchVirtualFirst to make it
  consistent with the "virtual" terminology.
  Now you can decide, whether the virtual paths will
  be searched before the webapp or after it.
  If searched before, external resources take precendence
  over internal ones. Before that change one couldn't overwrite
  resources already present in the webapp.

  -1: 
  -0: kkolinko: The patch itself is OK, but I think having a synonym will
   cause confusion. I'd prefer not to invent a new name, but mention the
   one that we already have when documenting virtualClasspath.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49343
  When ChannelException is thrown, remove listener from channel.
  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=948402
  +1: kfujino, kkolinko
  -1: 
   kkolinko:
    Maybe "this.channel.removeChannelListener(this.rpcChannel);" call
    has to be replaced with "this.rpcChannel.breakdown();"
  
  Additional patch.
  "this.channel.removeChannelListener(this.rpcChannel);" call is 
  replaced with "this.rpcChannel.breakdown();".

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49099
  Provide a mechanism for including requests rejected by the CoyoteAdapter in
  the standard access log
  http://people.apache.org/~markt/patches/2010-07-07-bug49099.patch
  This is a backport of: r950587, r950809, r951018, r951093, r951447,
                         r951892, r952295

* Backport the CSRF prevention filter to Tomcat 6 and configure the Manager and
  Host Manager applications to use it. The configuration is such that the using
  the old roles (manager, admin) will work and will bypass the CSRF protection
  but using the new roles (manager-gui, admin-gui etc.) will not bypass the CSRF
  protection.

      Needs to use TCCL instead of plain Class.forName(String) call.
      The /examples/jsp/jsp2/el/functions.jsp page breaks with a ClassNotFoundException.

* Fix https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=49521
  http://people.apache.org/~kkolinko/patches/2010-07-17_tc6_bug49521.patch
  - Disable scanning for a free port in Jk AJP/1.3 connector by default.
  - Do not change maxPort field value of ChannelSocket in its #setPort()
    and #init() methods.
  - Add support for "maxPort" attribute on a <Connector> element as a synonym
    for channelSocket.maxPort
